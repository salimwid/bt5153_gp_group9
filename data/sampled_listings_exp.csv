Most importantly, I use Airbnb as a host and as a guest so I live both situations understanding always how important it is for people to open their door to me. I am very respectful of other people spaces. On the other side I love hosting and be helpful to my guest because i know how it is to visit new places and how resourceful can be to have a generous host!
 
In general, I am not a big fun of too touristy places, especially if restaurant, always prefer the small and quirky situation where the locals love to go.
Love food, cooking and I am always keen to try new combinations and flavours. 
Very curious and a bit nerdy - when I can learn something new I get very excited! 
Passionate about music, jazz and blues but also electro and rock.
Easy going, clean and respectful of other people spaces.

Golden Rule: Treat others how you want to be treated!!
