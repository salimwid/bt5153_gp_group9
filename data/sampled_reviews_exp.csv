1517086,476903703,2019-06-27,269304396,Hannelore,"Leider hatten wir Pech mit der Wohnung, da Schimmelflecken und Schimmelgeruch als auch eine gewisse Unsauberkeit ( Haare und Flecken) uns zwangen auf Hotelzimmer auszuweichen und wir nun die teure Wohnung als auch 3 Hotelzimmer zu zahlen hatten. Mit der Gastgeberin war leider nicht zu reden, sie war zu keiner Kulanz bereit, sogar die Reinigungskosten wurden nicht rückerstattet. Insgesamt keine gute Erfahrung, denn wir hatten viel Stress und hohe Ausgaben."
19776668,232770402,2018-02-06,41555669,Emily,"This was our second stay at Ingrid's apartment and we enjoyed it thoroughly again. The place is spotless, in a good location and everything you need is provided. Ingrid is friendly, helpful and really easy to communicate with. We'll stay again!"
5300840,318759635,2018-09-04,19143618,Nina,"I had a wonderful stay, sadly only one night, which was quiet, comfortable and had everything I needed. James was prompt in his communication, and a super friendly host who's great to have a chat with. Hoping to stay again in the future!"
15161649,344760380,2018-11-04,59556089,Jeremy,"Alan is a great host and makes you feel right at home. my friend was really hungover in the morning and left later than the check out time and Alan wasn't bad about it. would recommend the place, it's simple and somewhere to rest your head."
14629205,278643997,2018-06-18,28769602,T-Hom,"My third stay in London, this was one of my favorite spots. Highly recommended."
2659707,420990110,2019-03-08,238100735,Maik,"This was my first stay with airbnb ever and definitely not my last. <br/><br/>Katherine and Craig are really nice and helpful with all issues we had! <br/>Also their cat „sausage“ is very lovely :)<br/><br/>The accomodation is perfect when you want to have a city trip to London. <br/>It does not take too long into the centre. <br/>Also, you can have a nice breakfast every morning before you leave to the sights. <br/>The room has everything in it what you need and even more. <br/>There is wifi available and you could play xbox or watch tv and netflix if you feel like. <br/><br/>In total, it was a very good experience!!!"
6982659,73500113,2016-05-08,68389216,Thomas,We loved the room and everything was provided. A Lovely clean simple room with a nice en suite. Neighbourhood felt really quiet and safe and really close to tube. 
45491001,423682296682430450,2021-08-07,212749877,Kwesi,"Great price for place, was a little smaller than pictured but it did the job. Great communication and amenities!"
21294445,206014338,2017-10-23,107533752,Charlotte,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
13905660,454994584,2019-05-19,109773599,Joanna,Our hen party weekend was fabulous but unfortunately the host did let us down with the property. We made the best of it as it was only for one night and didn't let it dampen our spirits.<br/><br/>The place needs a proper thorough clean and the beds do need looking in to - some were very nice but a lot of them we found far too uncomfortable to sleep on.<br/>All in all a good place to crash for a party but we wouldn't want to stay there for longer than one night.<br/><br/>It's a shame I am having to write this review as I have actually never left a bad review about  anything but I wanted to be honest.<br/><br/>The lady who met us for check in and out was fantastic though so thank you to her and for the bottle of prosecco!
18007955,149457983,2017-05-04,79127271,Sayo,Room as described.<br/>Coffee and biscuits. Very nice welcoming. Buses and shops very close. I would recommend this room as it's good value and our hostess and her son are really nice to meet.
11375998,510717094,2019-08-16,38585887,Olu,"Katy's home was the ideal place to host my family of 6 from Nigeria, everything was just as was described and as in the photos. It feels very homely, and spacious. Very quiet neighbourhood too with parks and amenities all within walking distance. Location was just perfect, if you want to take the bus or tube, Turnpike lane and Finsbury Park stations serving the Picadilly and Victoria lines are just a few stops away. Katy also is a great host, checking in every now and then to make sure we were alright and ready to provide anything we needed. Grateful to be have been entrusted with your home."
15465132,462571330,2019-06-02,260536389,Daniela,"we had a great time in this cottage in the suburbs, the neighborhood is adorable and well served by the means and everything you need for your stay. I personally met Elsa who was extremely available for our needs. I would go back again!"
29759917,473759455179386930,2021-10-15,164423901,Kim,Nice place and good access to Islington.
7183377,299693627,2018-07-31,12730875,Doug,"The one thing other reviews don't quite seem to capture is just how nice the back garden experience can be. Eleanor's windows slide away and give you complete access to the lush garden. It is nicely lit and is particularly lovely before the dawn or after the sun has set. The home is very comfortable and good for a family of four (although the bunk beds are best for kids who aren't too tall - and if your kids are very young, be aware that there are stairs that don't have a railing). One of our favorite things was the bedding in the master bedroom - four great pillows and a comfy duvet (kind of a rare find in our Airbnb experiences). Finally, as others have said, Eleanor was incredibly responsive and helpful."
15143351,328467512,2018-09-26,217096350,Gill,"A warm and welcoming family home. My room was spacious, with plenty of storage and a very comfortable bed. The tea and coffee facilities are a nice touch too. Excellent value and I would have no hesitation about booking again."
3196599,164987129,2017-06-30,56408234,Jenny,"Andy's place is SO convenient to everything in Clerkenwell/Farringdon.  Compared to most places in London, it's incredibly spacious!  You have a totally separate living room with two sofas, full kitchen and then spacious bedroom with dressers and a wardrobe.  <br/><br/>Being American, I was a little hesitant to stay somewhere without A/C but the temperature was perfect, even on hot days.  It's in a central location but also so quiet!  We slept with the windows open one night and it was almost silent, which is unheard of in the city.  <br/><br/>Great place that I would highly recommend and Andy is SO accommodating.  He was texting me from the minute I landed to coordinate my check in, which changed a few times and then was in touch throughout the stay to ensure we didn't need anything.  Highly recommended! "
310949,249959480,2018-04-03,166296269,Meg,"My husband and I arrived in London a snowy evening. It's Robert and Antonio cooked a nice dinner for us and gave us a very warm welcome. The house is clean and comfortabe, we do love the lake in front of the house. The shopping centres are about 10 minutes walk, we bought the food we liked and cooked our dinner most of the time. We stayed there for 16 nights. Though it took us a little bit long time to take the bus and train to the city centre and different towns nearby, we enjoyed the journey. We really appreciate the owners' help."
50362673,425083151538244883,2021-08-09,29472860,Heather,"This was a comfortable stay for our family of 3, including a 4 year old.  Plenty of room for us all, comfortable beds, and a surprisingly big back yard!  The place could use a bit more upkeep, but I think this is a new endeavor and those things will work themselves out over time.  Great communication, and easy check-in."
8728789,466593853,2019-06-09,100820604,Hannah J,The place was clean and just what we needed for a few nights in London.  Tom was helpful and let us check in early for a nap after our overnight bus. It's about a 10 minute walk to the Brixton tube station.  We really enjoyed our stay!
45795787,390372240374266451,2021-06-22,198663189,Misha,"The VUE IS INSANE! The place was clean and absolutely delightful!<br/><br/>Will and his team are awesome, professional and always on point.<br/><br/>Thank you for a beautiful stay will be returning soon!"
6996677,364314590,2018-12-30,20978443,Karine,"Vittoria répond facilement à toutes vos questions et son appartement est joli, très propre et bien situé. Très bon sejour chez vittoria"
14299729,97732193,2016-08-28,6738575,Katherine,Max and Billie were really flexible about picking the keys up and let us store our luggage in their office while we explored london for the day. The studio was exactly how it was on the photos and there were absolutely no surprises. Max and Billie even left us some welcome chocolates! We had a lovely time staying in this studio and the location is perfect for an authentic London experience. 
19968804,516518727,2019-08-24,198482230,Ian,"Room is nice an clean, bed was comfortable and has plenty of room for 2. Host was very responsive and helpful, and had left lots on nice extras in the room (water, cereal/breakfast food , reduced price for the set menu of the restaurant below).  Only downside was a smaller bathroom that had flushing/noise at random intervals from the plumbing"
2119937,366804404,2019-01-03,34068870,Carina,"We were out a lot and didn't see much of our hosts, but Soren still texted us during our stay to check if everything was fine and even brought us fresh towels after a few days. The room was nice and it was very convenient to have an own bathroom and an own entrance. Check in and check out were very flexible and we were happy that we could leave our luggage until we left for the airport. We had a lovely stay at Sorens place and can definitely recommend it. Thanks again!"
5081461,323752108,2018-09-16,1677254,성환,"가격대비 아주 훌륭합니다. breakfast가 좋습니다. 아주 청결하고 아늑한 방을 가지고 있습니다. 시내에서 멀긴 하지만, 처음만 좀 어려울 뿐 버스 (106번) 타고 finsbury 역만 나가면 어디든 쉽게 갈 수 있습니다. 저의 영국 여행 일정이 바빠서 호스트와 많은 시간을 보내지는 못했지만, 세심한 배려를 해주시는 좋은 호스트입니다."
4022582,72813800,2016-05-04,8288043,Zsofia,"I am very happy for the couple of nights I stayed by Naomi in her wonderful home. She is very lovely, welcoming host and her home is just as fantastic as on the pictures. The room is cosy, full of light and very nicely furnished. Naomi's two cats, Bubbles and Magic, were like the cherry on the cake for me. Thank you, Naomi!<br/><br/>"
28279185,540846899,2019-10-04,23760448,Kendal And Lorraine,"We had a delightful room with an equally delightful outlook. The room was cosy, very clean and had everything we needed. It was close to shops, cafes and public transport. Julie was a lovely host who made us very welcome. Her communication was outstanding. She even managed to map out a good economic way to get from Gatwick Airport to her house and were to buy an Oyster card en route."
10038491,98225245,2016-08-30,66282537,Katie,"We are a family of six so it's not easy to find affordable accommodation for us in a city like London. However, we struck it lucky with Emily's house. Location was perfect within in easy reach of Homerton station and we traveled to the centre of London every day with 4 small kids. Emily was a fantastic host and we would highly recommend her house. The local area is lovely too, full of little shops & cafes with in easy reach. Thank you Emily "

23374477,314877985,2018-08-27,210455881,Sara,"Very good location right in front of kings cross and st Pancras station. It can be a bit too noisy at night, but we were expecting it, due to the location. It is a well served area. The room is small but has everything you need and is clean. "
27863349,510486019,2019-08-16,261192320,Lorie,"Quiet, clean accommodation.  Close enough to walk to many sites and minutes from St Pancras/Kings Cross.  4 rooms in total with 2 shared bathrooms and shared kitchen but no issues with either.  Hosts are friendly and respond promptly to emails.  Enjoyed our stay here."
21263625,304932964,2018-08-10,204404411,磊,"It's a good location near the Surrey Quay and with the nice view. The owner Veronica is very kind to allowed us check-in earlier, and responded very quickly."

We had a great stay in this spacious and well equipped apartement and felt like home. Everything was as described and very clean. We went to London by bus and underground (Picadilly + Metropolitan) without any problems in 1 hour. We would like to come back again.
389967,164941300,2017-06-29,40606719,Ashley,We had a lovely stay while we were in Wimbledon. Frances was a wonderful host providing us a nice breakfast every morning and working around our schedule. The room and bathroom was well kept and very clean. Beds were comfortable also. We were able to walk to Wimbledon village within 15/20mins. There were plenty of restaurants to choose from in the village for dinner etc. Overall a great place to stay!
1941845,433514262,2019-04-06,11486328,Ruth,"We unfortunately never made it to Colum's place as our gearbox failed on the M5, however I've given Colum five stars as he couldn't have been more understanding and responsive. He made a very stressful situation a lot less stressful and for that we were very grateful, particularly with a 14 month old in tow! Fantastic host!"

14681392,662891293,2020-09-11,68201457,Matthew,"The room was very clean and spacious. The whole place was very nicely decorated as well. The location is also good as it’s in a leafy area of London in a quiet neighborhood, but still not too far from the centre. The check-in/out was easy as well.<br/><br/>The only thing we think could be changed is removing “breakfast included” as we were not given any information about it when we arrived and felt that it wasn’t really included. We wish it was not stated in the listing so that we could have prepared better for ourselves.<br/><br/>But overall good stay at Kirstie’s!<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Matt & Hyemin"
25811402,425529761,2019-03-18,84582066,Kathryn,Extremely clean and close to airport! Perfect for a layover a bit too long to stay in the airport!

I felt super welcome and never lost because they would always help me find the best way to my next destination, make suggestions for other good places to check out or just have me spending good times at the house with them. <br/>Loved it so much! I will absolutely be back!!!<br/><br/>"
22046992,521014377,2019-08-31,261217389,Patrick,"One of the best flats I have ever stayed in london. Hendon, great area, 24hr supermarkets in 5min walk, right next to middlesex uni, loads of parks around. It's lovely place!"

21523290,552632223,2019-10-22,108514025,Oliver,Octavia的房子地理位置很不错，位于地铁circle线上，抵达各个景点和火车站非常方便。房间很大，两层楼为一层地面一层地下室，各种设施应有尽有。房内有许多房主的物品非常温馨可爱，也有足够的空间放行李。房源唯一不足的是楼上浴室水压不足，洗浴不是很舒服。
8989885,63193687,2016-02-21,42581872,Christopher,I had a very great stay at Anita's lovely clean flat. Highly recommended!
12052198,225426833,2018-01-06,4146987,Nina,"We had a wonderful stay at Colin's place. The location was perfect - slightly away from the main tourist attractions but in an area with lots of shopping, great local restaurants and several grocery stores nearby. <br/><br/>Colin's wife Julia was always quick to respond and provided recommendations for dinner spots nearby. <br/><br/>The apartment itself was warm, comfortable and very stylish. A big plus for our kids was getting to play with toys, having stepping stools and other small details they are used to at home but you don't get in a hotel. <br/><br/>On our last day our flight was delayed but Julia and Colin were very flexible letting us stay as long as we needed to."

It's extremely important while you are traveling with small kids.  Multiple local restaurants and two large supermarkets are located in the neighborhood      John/Ann-Sofi are also very nice and responsive to answer all my questions. Overall, we had an excellent stay in London and would definitely book this flat again in the future!  "

That being said, Siobhan herself topped her perfect flat. She’s incredibly helpful, smart and funny, and hanging out with her when she was around was easily one of the best parts of my stay in London! I couldn’t recommend staying there more."

Nice attention to details such as providing kitchen roll, bottle of water, small portable sanitiser bottle, etc. The host is lovely and responsive. A supermarket was nearby too.  I would definitely stay here again."
17691357,196963454,2017-09-24,48724286,Brad,Liz is a gracious host. Her place is centrally located as explained in profile. The room was clean and spacious. The neighborhood is very chic being literally across the street from Hyde Park. I would recommend her place to a friend.

His communications are quite abrupt and aggressive. We agreed that we would pay an extra 35 pounds for a cleaner halfway through our stay by his request. This seemed strange but we did not wish to lose the booking so agreed. This actually was not for cleaning but for him to have someone check on the apartment. From this check-up he was annoyed we had not left the doors and windows open during the day. However, this is difficult for security reasons on a ground floor apartment and he knew we were working during the night and were asleep during the day. <br/><br/>Despite his accusatory messages, we agreed to try our best to do this. However, this was sadly not the first example of accusatory/aggressive communication.  When we asked about an outside bin and the collection days he abruptly voice messaged us to say use the neighbour's bins and look on the internet. These were not massive issues but set the tone for his future communications. Near the end of our stay, he said we had to say exactly when we were leaving. We explained how that was difficult as we were being collected by a friend after work as we were moving all our things elsewhere in the country. We had to leave in a rush when our friend arrived and accidentally left my new AirPods in the room. When we asked about these he was aggressive about how we had not told him we were leaving. He later sent an image of a stain on the table. We had not noticed this on the table. He accused us of destroying his 1000 pound table. This seemed both a rather excessive claim considering how it looked like wear and tear from the picture and rather expensive when the whole apartment is furnished with Ikea furniture. We then looked for the table on Ikea and it is 120 pounds, not the 1000 pounds earlier stated. He then continued with these aggressive messages and what felt like bullying tactics to get money. He did not want us to go through Airbnb for resolution. When we said would go through Airbnb he also noted how he has the Airpods but we will not get them back. <br/><br/>Overall, it is a shame that his overly emotive, aggressive and controlling communications have led to an upsetting experience which has also led me to have lost my property in my Airpods. Consequently, I cannot recommend Alberto as a host."

Location is perfect. I was on the 13th floor, and the view was amazing. The studio had a kitchenette, and cutlery, pots and pans were provided. The building has security on site at all times. The laundry facilities were good, the app was very convenient to use. Very nice table in the room with a comfortable chair to study. I have stayed over a month, and found it very comfortable. I would recommend staying at Chapter!"
7600355,293346551,2018-07-20,2819356,Martina,"I had booked a room at Colin's house for a friend. He was very happy and enjoyed the breakfast, which is a lovely extra you usually don't get through airbnb. Living in the same neighbourhood than Colin, I can tell that it is a pretty and safe area, quiet at night and gives you a break from the Londoner buzz. I would definitely book again a room for my friends at Colin's. "

La descrizione corrisponde esattamente alla realtà, e per ogni domanda che ho fatto ad Anish prima della prenotazione, ho avuto una risposta rapida e molto precisa. Anish è stato un ospite veramente perfetto, e quando siamo arrivati ci ha accolto con molta cordialità (e ci ha fatto trovare alcune cosa da mangiare e da bere). Lo spazio nella casa è più che perfetto per 4 persone, con 2 camere da letto e un ampio soggiorno dove poter mangiare e rilassarsi. La cucina, separata dalla zona giorno, è dotata di tutti i comfort (frigo, congelatore, fornelli, forno, microonde e macchina per caffè all'americana). La zona poi è veramente tranquilla, un quartiere residenziale tipicamente inglese, a pochi minuti dalla stazione ferroviaria di Norbiton, da cui si raggiunge il centro città in 25 minuti. In conclusione, assolutamente da consigliare!<br/>The stay in Anish's apartment was a wonderful experience for all my family. The description corresponds exactly to reality, and for every question I asked Anish before booking, I had a quick and very precise answer. Anish was a really perfect host, and when we arrived he welcomed us very warmly (and made us find some things to eat and drink). The space in the house is more than perfect for 4 people, with 2 bedrooms and a large living room where you can eat and relax. The kitchen, separated from the living area, is equipped with all the comforts (fridge, freezer, stove, oven, microwave and American coffee machine). The area is then really quiet, a typically English residential neighborhood, just a few minutes away from Norbiton train station, from which you reach the city center in 25 minutes. In conclusion, absolutely recommended!"

326633,29107786,2015-04-04,27579690,Nimrod,"The apartment itself is really nice.<br/>The location is not ideal since there's no subway station nearby. Using buses and the train is OK if you're not in a hurry.<br/>Please also note the flat is in the third floor with no elevator.<br/>The overall experience was fine, I enjoyed staying in the apartment very much"

The house was super clean, well maintained and perfect for our group of 6 persons. <br/>We can safely recommend Emilly's accommodation to friends and family.<br/>As a welcome there was free wine, water and coke, milk for coffee.<br/>The kitchen is equipped with everything you need: enough dishes, pots, pans; in the bathroom there are even showers, creams, plenty of toilet paper. We were able to park our car on a parking lot belonging to the house.<br/>Central London is easy to reach from the house: there are railway stations and bus stops nearby.<br/>In short: it was also through the beautiful accommodation a wonderful stay in London.<br/>Thanks again Emilly - you are truly a wonderful host!"

This studio apartment is in a perfect location, away from the hustle and bustle of Piccadilly Circus, but not too far that you can hop on the Tube or walk to Kensington. The neighborhood is quiet, but within a block of a major street for easy access. There is a lovely local coffee shop around the corner and great restaurants walking distance away. You truly get the local feel staying here, I'll definitely be back!"
