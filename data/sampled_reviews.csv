24872072,486350034,2019-07-12,114138829,Adrian,"Great location. Very friendly and helpful host. Very basic B&B. Very clean. No kitchen faciities for breakfast which I hadn't realised and the shower room which is tiny is across the hall, not en-suite, which again I hadn't realised. There is a lovely Italian restaurant and a nice chilled pub just a short walk away and the old docks are very interesting."

8259664,113869037,2016-11-14,49575237,Esteban,"No salia agua caliente de la ducha! La zona no es muy linda, si bien esta a 20 minutos caminando del Tower Bridge"
21713645,453649161,2019-05-16,7860200,Rafa,"El apartamento es pequeño pero con lo suficiente para llegar de un día entero en Londres y dormir. <br/>Tiene sofa-cama que no es muy cómodo.<br/>La ducha no funcionaba correctamente, o el agua salía fría o muy caliente y tenías q ir jugando para que te saliera tibia.<br/>La ubicación muy buena, a sólo 3 min andando de la estación de metro de Hammersmith que tiene conexión con 3 líneas del metro de Londres. A unos 20-25 min de picadilly circus. <br/>Los anfitriones muy amables que aunque no estaban en Londres en ese momento se preocuparon de que todo nos fuera bien."

1104183,184125839,2017-08-19,24411077,Steven,"Petra has a lovely and comfortable home. It is really well located within a neighborhood that has many great services, beautiful parks and several transit options. We were able to stay in the neighborhood and explore all day or quickly hop on a bus or tube to get almost anywhere quickly. The nice little back yard with a pergola, grill, apple tree and trampoline makes for a nice little oasis after a day of running around. One thing to consider if you'd like to stay at Petra's is that it's in a part of London that is lively, so expect to hear the hum of the city and the occasional reveler late into the night. <br/><br/>Petra herself is an excellent host and responded quickly to our needs if there was a hiccup with the an appliance or we needed to know where to get the best kabobs."
36666888,538948575,2019-09-30,40339495,Jennifer,"Great location and a wonderful place to stay while in London. Close to the bus stop, cute coffee shop and a gorgeous bridge. Definitely would stay there again when in London! Kasia is a wonderful host and goes above and beyond anywhere I’ve ever stayed (and I’ve stayed at a lot of air bnbs!). Thank you again for sharing your wonderful place with us!"
25452410,510535047,2019-08-16,21736144,Misty,Aiste and her partner were wonderful. The place was clean and in a great east end neighborhood. I would definitely stay again.
2230069,18724034,2014-08-31,5991980,Christian,"Reservation process quick , easy and welcoming , the instructions are straight forward . Shoreditch area is f-a-n-t-a-s-t-i-c , the apartment is perfectly situated and the tube is 7 minutes walking . We had a little issue during the stay , John and his team was responsive and resolve i (Website hidden by Airbnb) One of the bedroom is a bit noisy but there was earplugs just by the bed ..which is ohhh very very comfy ."
5535422,226219329,2018-01-09,113099972,宇萱,这是一个非常完美的房子，每周都有定期清洁，离Piccadilly线走路七分钟，公交车更近。周围外卖很好吃。设施也很齐全。住的很开心很舒适。
17359102,452547400,2019-05-13,248719358,Sze,"David and Savie were extremely friendly and pleasant people.<br/><br/>They greeted us with a warm welcome and we had some really fun conversations.<br/>The place was immaculate- the room, toilet, kitchen and living room was really clean. <br/><br/>The place is also really close to bus stops and to Oval tube station which made travelling around London so easy.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend staying here."
46037429,475118485188723618,2021-10-17,46617534,Mints,The place is clean and its easy to communicate and get a fast response from the host!
41981596,770472528,2021-06-14,340206823,Julia,Lovely place with a garden and close to Supermakets and the river.Also near Richmond for the Tube by Bus.
24987865,272405157,2018-06-03,9897184,Marc,"Great apartment, good communication and nice people. Ideal for Victoria Park or a night out in Hackney. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting the area"
20530556,245428361,2018-03-22,178386184,Kevin,"Just 5 minutes from Westferry DLR, and securely gated, this was a great location for a two day visit to the ExCEL centre."
8518658,216549100,2017-12-04,60909382,Ann,"very nice and clean house, hostile Ricardo, who let us stay longer than 11am, till we had to go to the airport. Thanks!"
16256750,206851055,2017-10-27,45512545,Maren,"We stayed at Angie´s für three days. The room ist very small and has a small double bed. The bathroom is shared with Angie. Everything is very clean. Angie was very polite and allowed to leave our luggage in the flat after our checkout, eg.<br/>You cannot get a room nearer King´s Cross Station. From here you get everywehre by tube without any problems.  It is no problem that you cannot use Angie´s kitchen as there are hundreds of restaurants and cafés near the flat. <br/>Although the room has a window to the backyard, it is quite noisy at nights if the window is open. But I think you cannot expect to get both a good location and a quiet room. <br/>Thanks a lot, Angie!"
18174705,563301766,2019-11-12,158196993,Jennifer,"Minda was a fantastic host. My boyfriend and I stayed for 4 days, 3 nights and it was more than enough for our time in London. Minda was kind to allow us access to her kitchen for breakfast, and had fresh squeezed orange juice every morning we were there.<br/><br/>The room is more suited for 1-2 guests, but it did have plenty of storage. The shower does require a step up into and it can be slippery. The shower door only covers maybe half the shower,  just need to be careful of where the shower head faces as you shower."
3621702,24821755,2015-01-03,22516171,Christopher,"Nous tenons à remercier Roger pour son accueil, sa gentillesse et sa disponibilité. Nous avons logé dans une chambre très propre et nous avions l'opportunité de profiter de tout l'appartement de type british, décoré avec goût. Nous y retournerons avec plaisir. Encore un tout grand merci à Roger."

10999340,122695539,2016-12-25,57716791,Maria,The host canceled this reservation 193 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
21048058,652148160,2020-08-16,145417556,Julie,"Lack of honesty, taken advantage of a covid situation.<br/>Due to the mandatory 14 day quarantine for arrivals from France, I had to cancel my weekend on the day of my departure. Not being responsible for this unfortunate situation, I therefore asked Dom if he could refund me, which he simply refused. So he took the full amount of the booking when I couldn't come and had no choice but to cancel everything."
22495513,563566936,2019-11-13,129428271,Andrey,"All 5 stars, Neil is a great host and provides you with a wonderful stay."

12188577,84619818,2016-07-08,34950676,Taran,My stay at Suzanne's was quick and painless. She was very communicative whenever I reached out via email. The place was cute and located to easy bus lines. 
24670253,406303631171659903,2021-07-14,19836836,Ben,Great flat. Brilliant location and very good value for money. Will definitely come back

6316365,48635299,2015-09-27,42880861,Laëtitia,Le logement correspond à l'annonce. Il est situé en dehors du centre de Londres mais la proximité du métro est très appréciable.<br/>Merci pour ces petits déjeuners typiques ! Yvonne est une hôte très sympathique ! Merci pour cette bonne humeur !!! <br/>A recommander 
17903756,640404196,2020-07-20,86966716,Hye Shin,"Tsahi’s place is just a stone’s throw away from King Cross. Bus stop right outside and overground station just next to his place. Tsahi was friendly and accommodating, great to get along with. He helped me with my luggage up to his 3rd floor apartment during both check in and check out. He is always available and responds quickly. His place is also extremely clean, all amenities available and a huge smart tv in the room. Would definitely return again."
14863559,135937094,2017-03-07,107862750,Stephen,"We were looking for somewhere that was quiet & peaceful with a little outside space.  Peter's place offered both.  Located quite close to Richmond Park was a bonus. As was the close proximity of a good English pub (there are two - you choose!) and good local transport links into East Sheen, Richmond, the Underground and into London.  The accommodation is small but enough room for two adults and so much better than a hotel room and much better value-for-money.  Our host and hostess were lovely and really, really helpful.  We'd have no problems about staying there again."
37240499,659348746,2020-09-01,354413948,Ahmed,Good clean and the area is good too. Great transport any easy access to the centre.
13347820,286002886,2018-07-05,34177148,Diane,"Our stay with Moira, Mick, Katie & Rose was a wonderful one, welcoming us into their home & nothing was too much trouble.  The room was a fantastic space, with everything you need, their hospitality was amazing and we felt at home straight away.<br/><br/>An ideal location for Wimbledon, both the courts and the queue, but also to transport into London.  <br/><br/>We will definitely be back to stay, thank you for your hospitality and local information.<br/><br/>Diane & Dave"
17374740,572312964,2019-12-02,39224309,Mike,"Anne's flat is fantastic! The location is perfectly situated amongst many wonder shops and restaurants, with easy access to buses and trains to move around the city. And the bagels at the little shop next door are superb! Overall great place to stay in London."
14786978,490810612,2019-07-19,255386957,Sonia,"Pretty good journey at Julia's home, our room was very clean !"

42324696,491910901990328644,2021-11-09,803289,Robin,Very convenient central location. Everything necessary was provided. Even managed to squeeze a washing machine into the space.<br/>A bedside table to put the phone on (and other items such as a lamp) would have been nice and made the room a little cosier.
11178621,443934513498527132,2021-09-04,213948016,Ewelina,"It was a lovely stay in a beautiful place. I can’t recommend more highly.

18573516,670155978,2020-10-02,167332071,Huashi,"Great location, wonderful communication, cosy room, clean kitchen and bathroom, fantastic water temperature, but the kettle in kitchen is too dirty to use, and the worst WI-FI ever in AirBnB, hope to be better"
7772930,84768149,2016-07-09,77090846,Dana,The flat was in an excellent location.  Mark did a great job communicating with us and quickly took care of our request. It is a typical older flat.  There is a short 1/2 flight if stairs to a lift or another short flight up to the flat.  
30338148,561974280,2019-11-10,17645485,Pablo,"Maz property, is really nice, well located in the Greenwich area, just a 30 minutes ride to the center, totally recommended.<br/><br/>Next year I may coming back for business again, I would love to stay back here.<br/><br/>Pablo R"
1262168,472964727126123065,2021-10-14,123923841,Malcolm,"Great location, walking distance to river and Victoria bus station. Close to food shops, cafes. House very well equipped with everything you will need for your stay.  Great communication with Sarah.  Quiet at night,  nice area."
410971,62631431,2016-02-15,57876301,Matthew,Marc was a great host. He was very flexible in getting us in to the flat and always replied to any questions very promptly. The flat is in a great location and allowed us to get around the city very easily. I definitely recommend Marc and his flat for anyone traveling to London.
23198288,434689521,2019-04-08,231971952,Melanie,Juli is an exceptional host. She went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. She even allowed us to leave our luggage in her flat after check out since our train departed at midnight. Thank you again!
37511619,488235703181286507,2021-11-04,11819625,Ika,Great location with ample space. The space is well-equipped and Maz is a great host!

13294159,111053303,2016-10-29,66079539,Madeleine,"On se sent très vite à l aise chez Gene qui est très discrète mais très disponible, prête à vous donner tous les renseignements nécessaires pour que le séjour se passe au mieux ( concernant les transports, entre autres). <br/>La chambre, simple, est agréable, propre, les draps sentent bon (!), il ne manque rien, Gene  a  même laissé quelques fruits sur la table. <br/>À recommander !"
8087824,63884165,2016-02-28,52655524,Morena,"Everything was perfect. We loved it here, the room was super clean and large and all the facilities were great as well. Close to restaurants, bus stations and underground. And close to the Thames and the famous blue Tower Bridge."
37047150,414317401566787934,2021-07-25,86131411,Naj,"It's lovely room to rent and location is great for me as I wanted in Barnet. I've not met Luz personally, but I met her sister and she was welcoming helpful and friendly.  House was very clean and tidy and very convenient room. I highly recommend it."
24045624,598561341,2020-01-27,121459373,Tam,"Bob’s home is comfy and conveniently located on the bus route no.3, which brings you to Westminster Square and Brixton tube station. The beds are soft and we all had nice sleep. The bathroom and kitchen are a bit dated but they are all well functioning. Bob is a welcoming host as he always answers guests’ enquiries. I would highly recommend Bob’s home to anyone who is gonna visit London!"
3588725,36096467,2015-06-25,31984077,Shirley,"Stan and Milena and their children made my family of four feel immediately at home. The room was spacious, bright and clean, and having our own bathroom was a real plus as well. The hosts were only too happy to help with anything we needed, right down to a drive to the movie theatre our first night there, which I felt was above and beyond what they had to do! The neighbourhood was quiet and only a couple of blocks to the train station; you can be in the heart of London in 35-45 minutes. A small supermarket was just a five minute walk away.  We would definitely recommend this place and look forward to returning ourselves.<br/><br/>Shirley and Rob"
7107420,49667524,2015-10-05,24371590,Hannah,Mehdi was a very welcoming and friendly host. He collected us from the tube station and showed us around his beautiful home. We were provided with anything we could have wanted and more. Mehdi was also very helpful with information about the local area and transport links. The room was peaceful and quiet. The apartment was spotlessly clean. It is also situated in a perfect location to explore London from. 
37451882,583798412,2019-12-29,139521477,Wai Lap,"Great house, kind host, good location with well designed and furnished house.<br/><br/>Steve and Dana will provide full support to visitors, I will truly visit again in my next stay in UK, highly recommended to all families or travelers."
10546640,150950497,2017-05-10,65075397,Megan,"Carmen and Luisa were good hosts. The room was clean, and we had full use of the kitchen and bathroom. The quiet hours (11pm to 9am) were mostly reasonable, and Carmen and Luisa supplied some shampoo and body wash to use in the shower. However, the door to our room did not have a lock on it, and they constantly had friends over, which made me a little nervous. It is a bit scary to leave important documents and money in a room that you know can be accessed by your host's random friends at any time. The flat was in a great location; it was close to two major tube lines and a walk into the city center only took about 50 minutes. Overall, I would say it was a nice place to stay. "
756481,176507397,2017-07-31,44067836,Elsie,The studio was central and clean with all the essentials. Communication with Alessandro was great. We really enjoyed our trip thank you! 
81449,9051529,2013-12-03,8956785,Sandra,"Kris is a terrific host! He was there upon our arrival to show us around. His welcome package is detailed and contained everything we needed to know. The flat is in a great location on a quiet street. It's ideal for exploring London, both via the tube and on foot. The pool was an added bonus for me - so marvellous to have a swim after a day of walking! "
9967303,281007665,2018-06-24,66942547,Jonathan,"Super moment passé à Londres. Nous n'avons pas eu le plaisir de rencontrer Julia qui s'est tout de même très bien occupée de nous. Conseils, directions, petites attentions. L'appartement est très propre, cosy et le quartier sympa. Proche de plusieurs arrêts de bus, vous serez au centre ville de Londres en 20min. Vous trouverez également commerces et restaurants à proximité. Bon voyage."
13763334,135571900,2017-03-05,116387578,Laura,Leslie and his wife are very nice and helpful at any time. They also took us from the airport and back when we had to leave. The room was nice and clean and we loved to stay there. Even though kitchen and bathroom has to be shared it was not bothering. Thank you!

1310624,585807027,2020-01-01,1224858,Amanda,"Alison's house feels like a true home away from home. Our room was spacious, very comfortable and perfectly clean. The house is a wonderfully quirky family home, with a glorious huge kitchen in which to have your (delicious) breakfast and a chat with Alison and her lovely husband - such a treat. We were treated like family, and enjoyed our time there very much. We definitely hope and plan to return at some point when we're in the area. Thank you!"

Such a lovely, cosy little cottage and the bedroom on the top floor with ensuite bathroom is so comfortable. <br/>It really felt like home and Jo is so lovely and friendly. Went out of her way to make sure we could get in ok when we arrived (as we arrived late) and even bought us bread, eggs, milk etc for breakfast!<br/>Couldn't recommend it more! Perfect for a few days in London and so central!"

Laura is wonderful--so accommodating and welcoming, and really made me feel right at home.  Her roommate Feedy was gone for the first few weeks of my visit but I had a great time getting to know her as well during the second half of my stay.  I had booked Laura's place for an extended work trip and found the location to be super convenient--just a quick walk from either the Hackney Downs or Hackney Central Overground stations, and lots of bus service as well.  It was great to be able to use her beautiful kitchen and common spaces in the evenings when I got home to make dinner or watch TV.  The bedroom itself is spacious with a big comfy bed, and it's great to have the balcony as well, which is really lovely.  Thank you, Laura and Feedy!  I can't wait to come back again soon!"

Your communication was above and beyond and you provided me with lots of handy tips and suggestions for getting out and seeing London! Thanks again :)"
19763087,463529925,2019-06-03,142657576,Ramses,"All communication went smooth and we were warmly welcomed upon arrival. We had a nice stay and the room was quiet and the bed comfortable. We enjoyed walking through the neighborhood on our way to and from public transport.<br/>We only have one minor comment; there was stuff stored in the closet, so there wasn’t much room for our clothes."
6051753,57676680,2015-12-28,42331278,Soon,My 5 days at Surabhis place has been awesome! Such a cosy beautiful house with ample greeneries and public transport. Surabhi has been extremely helpful with suggesting places to visit. Highly recommended!

18633538,446315092,2019-05-01,94719526,Bianca,"Alessandro was an amazing host! His tips and travel map were incredibly helpful. We felt safe staying in this area, and had all the amenities we needed. We were close to the train which we used to get around mainly. The view from his apartment is stunning at night. We would regularly enjoy a glass of wine while overlooking the river. Overall, we were very impressed with Alessandro and his place."
10584673,68257421,2016-04-03,65024921,Anila,"Immaculately clean modern room that suited myself wife and two young children perfectly for one night. Location was just right to visit the sights in London. (within a couple of minutes walking distance to Picadilly Circus and the tube). I didn't have to walk far in the morning to find breakfast for my hungry family. <br/><br/>The street was a quite noisy in the evening and into the early hours as previously mentioned but once inside all was cosy, safe and secure (despite it being in the middle of London's Soho district). <br/>If i could suggest one improvement I would ask Henry to put up some decent blinds or curtains to block out the light, noise and the goings on outside. Other than that, it was an enjoyable stay."
