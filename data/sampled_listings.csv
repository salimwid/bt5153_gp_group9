I have recently re-trained as an interior designer and my husband has a property development business.  We renovated our house in 2013 taking it back from 5 flats to a comfortable and warm family home in which we love spending time in together.  

My husband is a great cook and we and our children are all foodies.  You will often find us cooking and trying new things out in the kitchen or barbequing up a feast in the garden.

We are also lovers of the outdoors and make regular trips to the country to visit grandparents often taking to bike riding across the Somerset levels or skimming stones at the seaside on Hayling Island.

Sport is a big feature in our lives too, both playing and watching.  Martin and Thomas play tennis and football and are both season ticket holders of local football team QPR whilst Annabelle is enjoying her first experience of playing netball.

We are keen to make a great impression on all our Airbnb guests and help make your stay a memorable one!  So, any questions you have please don't hesitate to ask!

The area gets its name from a time when it was the only borough outside the City of London. Beyond the jurisdiction of the City authorities, in the 16th and 17th centuries the area was a playground famed for its inns, theatres and the notorious Southwark Fair which was shut down in 1762 after being deemed too debauched. It retains enormous character in many of its buildings, streets and shops, and a great mix of cultural opportunities remain. There are famous theatres, you’re never more than a brisk walk away from wonderful pubs dating back to medieval times, and it’s home to Borough Market, the Tate Modern and Europe’s tallest building, The Shard.
